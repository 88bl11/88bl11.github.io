Good evening folks. My first proper post is slightly diffrent to what i had planned, where i was going to start diving into some data sources and some examples of what can be achieved.

I feel its right to give you a little background on my experince with Splunk before I start going on about things you can do.

I have been with Splunk for a little over 4 months now, prior to that I worked for the Ministry of Defence for around 11 years, in Incident response and threat hunting. In that time I started using Splunk as a newby around 4 and half years ago simply for email and web logs, evolving it into a full enterprise SIEM soloution.

So before we jump in with the hands on creating glorious visualisation and Splunk Motorcycles and other crazy things, i thought i would share some useful links first. I wont cover the installation of Splunk as this is dependant on your OS really to cover it off. what I will do is provide you with some useful links as to the first steps in your Splunk journey.

The useful stuff:

Splunk is FREE to download and comes with a FREE licence, so you can get on and start playing with it for nothing.
