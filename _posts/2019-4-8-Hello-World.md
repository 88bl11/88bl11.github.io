So for a long time now, I have been tinkering away on lots of little projcets. I lose track of where I am with them because something more interesting at the time comes up and things get put back...

In an attempt to not only organise these projects, but to share some of my tinkering with others, I decided to create my GitHub. I have many things private on there but am slowely realising, theres no fear to making them public! but what more could i do.....

And that was it, why don't I make a blog of the steps I follow in the tasks I take. This way, I can share my experiences (or problems..) and look back on them as I need too.

My plan is to share my Splunk work on here but I will also include other bits and pieces of things that I do.
